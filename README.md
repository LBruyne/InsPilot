# Refinity
The frontend for Refinity: a multimodal creative stimulus system.

## Quick start

### dependency version

A dependency version is a recommended REQUIRED version, not a NEEDED version.

If you find any problem during your development, that may be a problem of dependencies versions conflict.

Some outer environment (dependencies versions) is NEEDED and listed:

- NodeJS. Run `node -v` to check a `node` is installed or not. The node version during development is v16.16.0.

### local

Run the command `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies (`node_modules`) according to your package manager.

Then run the command `npm run start` to initialize a front-server in your configured port (such as 3000).

Browser the application in `localhost:port`.
